/**
 * Registers business logic contracts with a resolver.
 *
 * This function performs the following steps:
 * 1. Gets business logic keys from each contract in the provided address list
 * 2. Creates registry data objects containing keys and addresses
 * 3. Registers the business logics with the resolver contract
 * 4. Validates the transaction response
 *
 * @param deployedContractAddressList - Object containing addresses of deployed contracts to register
 * @param businessLogicResolver - Address of the business logic resolver contract
 * @param signer - Ethereum signer to execute transactions
 *
 * @throws Will throw an error if registration transaction fails validation
 *
 * @remarks
 * Each contract in the address list must implement the IStaticFunctionSelectors interface
