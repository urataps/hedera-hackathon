# Description

The SDK enables web applications (or any other client-facing application) to interact with the smart contracts deployed on Hedera. This package is part of the Asset Tokenization Studio monorepo.

## Workspace Context

This SDK is located at `packages/ats/sdk` within the monorepo and depends on the contracts package (`packages/ats/contracts`). The build process automatically handles these dependencies when using workspace commands.

# Installation

From the monorepo root:

```bash
npm ci                    # Install all workspace dependencies
npm run ats:sdk:build     # Build the SDK
```

For local development of the SDK only:

```bash
cd packages/ats/sdk
npm run build
```

# Build

Build the SDK using workspace commands from the root:

```bash
npm run ats:sdk:build
```

Or build all ATS components:

```bash
npm run ats:build
```

# Test

Run SDK tests:

```bash
# From root
npm run ats:sdk:test

# Or locally
cd packages/ats/sdk
npm test
```

# Test

The SDK tests are located in the _**tests**_ folder at the root of the sdk module.

Before running the tests you will need to create an ".env" file following the ".env.sample" template.

Then to execute all the tests run this command from the _sdk_ folder:

```
npm run test
```
